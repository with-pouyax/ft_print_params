# ft_print_params

This repository contains a simple yet effective C program designed to print all command-line arguments passed to it, with each argument printed on a new line. This program is particularly useful for demonstrating the handling and processing of command-line arguments in C programming.

## Program Overview

The main functionality revolves around iterating through each argument passed to the program (`argv`) and printing it to the standard output. This example serves as a foundational exercise for understanding how command-line arguments are accessed and manipulated in C.
